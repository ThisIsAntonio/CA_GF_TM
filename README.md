# Cellular Automata, Game of Life and Turing Machine (Server/Client)

## Project Description

This project is part of the CST8221 course. It involves the development of a Java application to model and simulate various components within a system. The project is organized into multiple packages, each responsible for different aspects of the system.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code of the project, organized into packages.
  - `ca/`: Contains classes related to the "Cellular Automata" part of the project.
  - `cs/`: Includes classes related to the "Component System".
  - `gl/`: Contains the "Game of Life" code.
  - `support/`: Includes support classes and utilities for various functionalities.
  - `tm/`: Contains classes for the "Turing Machine", organized into client and server packages.

- **doc/**: Contains automatically generated documentation, including Javadoc and other documentation files.

- **bin/**: (Ignored in the repository) Contains compiled files generated by the compiler.

- **resources/**: Additional files like images, configuration files, etc.

- **.gitignore**: Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git, such as binaries and environment-specific files.

## Requirements

- **Java 8** or higher.
- **JavaFX SDK** (Make sure to download and install it separately).
- **Eclipse IDE** or any other IDE compatible with Java projects.
- Build tools like **Maven** or **Gradle** (optional, if you decide to use one of these for dependency management).

## How to Run the Project

### Using the Batch Script

The project can be easily compiled and executed using the provided batch script `JAP.bat`. This script automates the entire process, including compilation, JAR creation, and execution. Here’s what the script does:

1. **Clear previous build artifacts**: It removes any previous compiled files and errors.
2. **Compile the source code**: The script compiles all the Java source files from the `src` directory into the `bin` directory.
3. **Create the JAR file**: It packages the compiled classes and resources into a JAR file named `JAP.jar`.
4. **Generate Javadoc**: The script generates Javadoc documentation for the project.
5. **Run the JAR file**: Finally, it executes the JAR file using JavaFX.

### Steps to Execute the Batch Script:

1. **Install JavaFX**: Ensure you have JavaFX installed. You can download it from the official website. After installation, make sure to update the `JAP.bat` file to point to your local JavaFX SDK directory by modifying the `SET JAVAFXDIR` variable.

2. **Run the Script**: Double-click `JAP.bat` or run it from the command line within the project directory:
   ```bash
   ./JAP.bat
## Manual Execution
If you prefer to run the project manually:

1. Compile the project using your IDE or the command line.
2. Ensure that the JavaFX library is correctly configured in your project’s build path.
3. Execute the main class cs.CSModel from your IDE or using the following command:
  java --module-path "path_to_your_javafx_sdk" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar JAP.jar
